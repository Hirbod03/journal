# My Coding Journal 
## About

Hello — welcome to my journal! I'm starting this after graduating to stay motivated, keep learning, and stay busy through today’s wild job market. It’s where I jot down what I’ve been coding, share thoughts (technical and otherwise), and try to track how I’m growing along the way.

## What to Expect

- **Daily Logs:** Quick notes on what I worked on, what broke, what I fixed, and what I learned.
- **Code Snippets:** Examples from projects, experiments, and tutorials.
- **Technical Ramblings:** Unfiltered thoughts on code, tech, and figuring out a career in all this.
- **Learning Resources:** I'll try my best to link all the tutorials and resources that I come by.

## Why This Journal?

Cause I really like having green tiles in my github commit history :)
